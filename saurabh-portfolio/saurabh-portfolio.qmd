## Appendix: LLM-Generated Draft and Commentary

### LLM-Generated Draft Outline
*Generated via Tool, e.g., Grok on 10/5/2025:*

**Prompt**: “Create an outline and text for a one-page MBA student portfolio.”

**Outline**:
1. **Header**: Name and title (e.g., MBA Candidate).
2. **About Me**: Brief introduction to background and goals.
3. **Education**: Academic qualifications and achievements.
4. **Experience**: Professional roles and key accomplishments.
5. **Skills**: Core competencies relevant to business.
6. **Contact**: Professional contact details.

**Sample Text**:
- *About Me*: “I’m a driven MBA student with expertise in marketing and analytics, aiming to create value through strategic insights.”
- *Education*: “MBA, marketing university, 2026. Focus: Marketing. Courses: Strategic Management, Analytics.”
- *Experience*: “Marketing Specialist at [Company], increased traffic by 30% via SEO.”
- *Skills*: “Analytics, leadership, marketing strategy, Excel.”
- *Contact*: “Email: example@email.com, LinkedIn: [link].”

### Commentary
I used the LLM-generated outline as a starting point because it provided a clear, professional structure for a one-page portfolio. The sample text was helpful for inspiration but was too generic, so I rewrote it to reflect my specific experiences and voice. For example, I expanded the *Experience* section to include quantifiable results (e.g., “40% traffic increase”) and tailored the *Skills* section to highlight MBA-relevant competencies like leadership and analytics. I excluded the headshot/logo option to keep the design simple and text-focused, as per the assignment’s emphasis on accessibility. The LLM’s contact section was retained but updated with placeholder details for submission.
